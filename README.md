# Simple-Facial-Detection
Inspired by opencv  & Marcelo Rovai <br>
Uses pretrained models to draw a rectangle around forward facing faces <br>
Make sure you have a webcam and specify the correct one if you have multiple in cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) (default is 0) <br>
You can use other opencv models for other kinds of object detection if you change the xml file under the Cascades folder <br>
